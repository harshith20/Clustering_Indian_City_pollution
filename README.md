# Clustering_Indian_City_pollution
EDA, future forecasting using LSTM and clustering Indian cities based on their air pollution levels


## Objective
These are the things I wanted to do and check once I saw the data
  
  1.compare all pollutant levels with time for every city
  
  2.compare mean of pollutants with time for all cities
  
  3.find min and max pollutant level consisting city
  
  4.find city having higer pollutant increate rate
  
  5.find high pollutant level period for all cities
  
  6.pie hart for no of days each city is in safe AQI limits
  
  7.find months having +ve pollutant increase rate(AQI)
  
  8.DO clusterering and categorize cities
  
  9.Predict cities polutant levels for the future and find max polluted cityÂ¶
